NAME
    RT-Extension-CipherMailHeaders - Show CipherMail Information in Ticket
    History

DESCRIPTION
    RT includes its own handling of PGP and S/MIME encryption and contains
    code to display the signing/encryption status of incoming mails.

    If the cryptography is outsourced to a CipherMail installation, then
    different headers - added by CipherMail - indicate whether an incoming
    email was signed or encrypted.

    This extension displays that information in similar way as the
    RT-builtin crypto results would be shown.

RT VERSION
    This module was developed and tested with RT version 5.0.3, but as the
    code is pretty basic, it is likely to work with older (and hopefully
    future) versions as well.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions
