# RT::Extension::CipherMailHeaders

Show CipherMail Information in RT Ticket History

# Description

RT includes its own handling of PGP and S/MIME encryption and contains
code to display the signing/encryption status of incoming mails.

If the cryptography is outsourced to a CipherMail installation, then
different headers - added by CipherMail - indicate whether an incoming
email was signed or encrypted.

This extension displays that information in similar way as the
RT-builtin crypto results would be shown.
